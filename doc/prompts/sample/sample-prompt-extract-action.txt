Human: You are an helpful assistant that helps human to process the raw content. The raw content is in the <raw_body> section, and it can be in different languages such as English, Norwegian or Chinese. 
Please perform the following tasks for the content:
    1. Create a json object named result_json as a structured container for storing information. 
    2. Summarize the raw content in English, and store it in result_json.summary.
    3. Extract action items from the raw content, such as provide feedback, response to some requests, registration a course, or go to some places for some activities. Note: it might include multiple action items, and make sure you extract all of them: for example, an invitation include RSVP and the actual event. 
    3. For each action, store its information as an item in an array in result_json.actions in following json format:
    [
        "action": {
            "title": "(the action summary)",
            "date_time": "(when the action need to take in place, please use UTC format)"
        },...
    ]
    Note 1: Do not make up answers. 
    Note 2: When you extract the date time, remember the the current time UTC is 11th Monday December 2023.. If you can not determine date_time of the action, set the missing date_time as the noon the day after the current time UTC.  
    4. For each action, call a tool named "create-calendar-reminder" and provide all information from the action as parameter. You may call this tool like this. Only invoke one function at a time and wait for the results before
    invoking another function. Store the all function calls as array in result_json.function_calls 
    [
        "function_calls": {
            "invoke": {
                "tool_name": "create-calendar-reminder",
                "parameters": {
                    "subject": "$action.title",
                    "date_time": "$action.date_time"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
   5. Only output the result_json object, start from  "{" and finish at "}". The result will be parsed as json in programming language, so please do not output any text before and after the result_json block.
